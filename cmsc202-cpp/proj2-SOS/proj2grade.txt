Student ID: end1

Max grade: 100 
Raw grade: 86
Late penalty: 0
Total grade: 86

(Total grade = Raw grade - Late penalty)


General comments:

isSubset should have checked if an element in the host is anywhere
in B rather than checking if the i'th element in the host matched
the i'th element in B.

You dont want to always make the intersection SoS the opposite
type as the host SoS

I. Critical Errors

   None

   No submission (skip rest) 0

   Program does not compile or does not run, or runs but does not
      produce output even after minor tweaks.  Grading based on effort
      and on compiling with mytest.cpp.

      Removing one or two major bugs will fix this project. (40-50)
      Significant progress made, but major rewrite is necessary. (30-40)
      Not much progress made. (10-30)
      Barely started coding. (0-10)

      Score = 

      Rest of grade sheet is skipped.
