General comments:

Perhaps too many comments, comments are very helpful but you have almost every line commented.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
I. Critical Errors

  X None

   No submission (skip rest) 0

   Program does not compile or does not run, or runs but does not
      produce output even after minor tweaks.  Grading based on effort.

      Removing one or two major bugs will fix this project. (40-50)
      Significant progress made, but major rewrite is necessary. (30-40)
      Not much progress made. (10-30)
      Barely started coding. (0-10)

      Score = 

      Rest of grade sheet is skipped.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Program Design and Structure

    Program design and structure are reasonable 

    Superfluous #includes  -1
    
    No function prototypes for helper functions  -1

    Prints output from SolveCipher -2

    Poor loop structure  -1 to -3
       Comment:

    Declares array inside loops -1

    Unnecessary use of C++ string class -1

    Uses strcpy instead of strncpy, strcmp instead of strncmp, ...  -1


-----------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Coding Standards

   Program has good indentation, comments and choice of variable names

   Poor/inconsistent indentation scheme  -2

 X No/poor comments for helper functions (needs pre- and post-conditions)  -3
      (not needed for Decipher() and SolveCipher())

   In-line comments are:
      terse and not meaningful -3
      non-existent -5

   Poor choice of variable names -1
      Comment:

   Uses "magic numbers" (e.g., 65 instead of 'A', 26 instead of ALPHALEN) 
      [ WARNING THIS TIME ]
