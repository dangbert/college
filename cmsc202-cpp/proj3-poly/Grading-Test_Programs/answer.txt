*** Tests of evaluate() and degree()

p(x) = 13 x^5 + 7 x^2 + 1

  p has degree 5
  p(0) = 1
  p(-3) = -3095
  p(2) = 445

q(x) = 2 x^7 - 5 x^2 + 1

  q has degree 7
  q(0) = 1
  p(-3) = -4418
  p(0) = 1

r(x) = x^2 - 3 x + 2

  r has degree 2
  r(0) = 2
  r(1) = 0
  r(2) = 0

zero(x) = 0

  zero(1) = 0 (should be 0)
  Degree of zero() is -1
  Degree of zero polynomial is technically -infinity;
  Should return something sensible, e.g. zero or negative.

three(x) = 3

  three(0) = 3 (should be 3)
  Degree of constant 3 is 0
  Degree of a non-zero constant should be zero.

*** Tests of add() and subtract()

p(x) = 13 x^5 + 7 x^2 + 1

q(x) = 2 x^7 - 5 x^2 + 1

a(x) = x^17 + 141 x^12 + 3 x^10

  p(x) + q(x) = 2 x^7 + 13 x^5 + 2 x^2 + 2
  The sum has degree 7

  q(x) + p(x) = 2 x^7 + 13 x^5 + 2 x^2 + 2
  The sum has degree 7

  a(x) + p(x) = x^17 + 141 x^12 + 3 x^10 + 13 x^5 + 7 x^2 + 1
  The sum has degree 17

  p(x) - q(x) = -2 x^7 + 13 x^5 + 12 x^2
  The difference has degree 7

  q(x) - p(x) = 2 x^7 - 13 x^5 - 12 x^2
  The difference has degree 7

  p(x) + 0 = 13 x^5 + 7 x^2 + 1
  0 + p(x) = 13 x^5 + 7 x^2 + 1
  p(x) - 0 = 13 x^5 + 7 x^2 + 1
  0 - p(x) = -13 x^5 - 7 x^2 - 1

p(x) = 13 x^5 + 7 x^2 + 1

q(x) = 2 x^7 - 5 x^2 + 1

a(x) = x^17 + 141 x^12 + 3 x^10

  p(x)q(x) = 26 x^12 + 14 x^9 - 63 x^7 + 13 x^5 - 35 x^4 + 2 x^2 + 1
  The product has degree 12

  q(x)p(x) = 26 x^12 + 14 x^9 - 63 x^7 + 13 x^5 - 35 x^4 + 2 x^2 + 1
  The product has degree 12
