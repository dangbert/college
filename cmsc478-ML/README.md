## Labs:
* lab1: Intro to R. Arrays, matrices, graphs, working with the "College" (admissions) dataset.
* lab2: Simple and Multiple Regression.
* lab3: Logistic Regression. With sensor/threat data.
* lab4: Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA. "Weekly" dataset for returns on stocks.
* lab5: Resampling Methods.  "Default" dataset of credit card default data with a logistic regression model.
* lab6: Subset selection.  "College" dataset, forwards/backwards stepwise selection, cross-validation.
* lab7: Regularization and Dimension Reduction. "College" dataset, linear model, ridge regression, lasso model, and PCR and PLS (rank reduction methods).
* lab8: Non-Linear Methods.  "College" dataset with forward stepwise selection, GAM model, and linear model.

## Projects:
