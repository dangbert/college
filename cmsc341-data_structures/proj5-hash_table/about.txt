Dear Student,

Here are your individually assigned parameters for your implementation
of Project 5 for CMSC 341.  (Yes, you are getting this from me
even if you are not in my section.)

The project description is available here:

  http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341/projects/proj5.shtml

Your parameters are:

   degree: 5
   ejection limit: 20
   randomness level: Option #3 not very random

Make sure that you implement your project using these parameters.
We want to have a good distribution of data for this experiment.
