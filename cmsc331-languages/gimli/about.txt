Programming Project: Due by 11:59pm, Tueday , October 25.

Consider the files skeleton.lex and skeleton.y. Add rules to them as needed to
implement a syntax checker for the Gimli language designed last week. Your
grammar may vary slightly from what we talked about last time.

You should place comments in your code to explain this.
But the grammar you use should not be ambiguous (which happens when YACC reports
"reduce/reduce" conflicts.)

There is a makefile available too. Submit your Lex and YACC files as attachments
to an email. Also attach a typescript file that demonstrates the features of the
program. Send that email to the TA, Sriraj, and cc me.
