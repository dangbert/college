Write Lisp functions to:
(1) compute the volume of a sphere, given its radius
(2) compute the real AND COMPLEX roots of a quadratic equation
(3) take a simple list of numbers and return a list consisting of the smallest
    and largest numbers in the input list
(4) implement the quicksort algorithm which takes a simple list of integers and
    sorts them. 

(5) And write a Lisp function that takes three arguments: a list of integers
called aList, an integer called min, and an integer called max.  The function
returns the number of elements in aList that fall in the range min <= x <=max,
where x is an element of aList.  If aList is empty, the function should return
0.  You can define additional “helper” functions if you like.

Extra credit: Demonstrate the array functions in Common Lisp by taking two
matrices of your choice, m x n and n by p for values of m, n, and p greater than
or equal to one, and perform matrix multiplication.. No fair using "canned"
matrix multiply functions that may come with Common Lisp!
