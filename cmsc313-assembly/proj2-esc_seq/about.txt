First check if the char after the slash is "a-z"
Have a table of 26 bytes mapping each escape character to its escape sequence

for:
    // You can do following with MUL, or something easier
    total_value = (total_value * 8) + digit_value;
    (we're multiplying by a power of 2 so do something easier
    like a binary shift)
